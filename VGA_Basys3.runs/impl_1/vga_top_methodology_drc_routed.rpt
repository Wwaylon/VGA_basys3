Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#31 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.797 ns between vga_timing_unit/v_pos_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_25mhz_clk_wiz_0) and bram_addr0/A[9] (clocked by clk_100mhz_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
